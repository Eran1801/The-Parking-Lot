## In this repostiry we implement an interface for a worker of kennel. We are using Pymongo and MongoEngine to connect to a DataBase.
### The interface can perform a variety of operations ( more to come ) related to the kennel as : 

* Login your account - There are 2 kinds of employee in the kennel - simple employee and a manager. All workers in the kennel must first log in with a unique email and password 
In order to do some action.

* Create a user - To do any action in the kennel all workers must have a user first.

* Book a cage - As an employee or a manager you can book a cage to a dog, just put all the details required and that's it.

* Get all the current info about the kennel - In all time all the workers can see the status of the kennel, in aspect of dog nanme, cage number and check-out date

* Info and help - Any Worker in the company can send a request for info/help directly to the manager on any aspect related to the kennel or in general.


### If you have any suggestions for improving or adding features to the interface I would love to hear, you can contact me via my email: Eranlevy9@gmail.com
